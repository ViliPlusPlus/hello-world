Hello, my name is Vili and I am an aspiring programmer.<br/>
I live in Slovenia and I am 19 years old at this point in time.<br/>
I am currently learning Java but I would like to learn C++ in the future.<br/>
What I like most about programming are algorithms and AI.<br/>
I also enjoy competative programming.<br/>
